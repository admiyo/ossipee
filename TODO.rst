These are things that I would like to do but have not gotten to yet.
Some of them will never get done.

- Use THe File Tast to generate the config if it is missing
- Make a profile for each of the arches (RHEL7 VS Centos for example)
- Tear down all VMs attached to the networks upon teardown servers
- collect the common variables
- register all ipa-clients by having an inventory group for them
